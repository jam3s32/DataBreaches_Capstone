    "I have a keen interest in understanding how data breaches occur as I have always enjoyed organisational security. I wanted to understand and analyse what the constant threats were to an organisation and the language used to depict real life threats. For example, cards, fraud, skimming. \n",

    "I then decided to see if I could use Natural Language processing techniques along with Machine Learning to categorise large fields of text into a certain type of data breach. For example, can I scrape a dataset or journal document off the web and deploy it as an unseen story through the model to categorise the type of breach that occured. \n",

## [Motivations](#Motivations) ##

I have a keen interest in understanding how data breaches occur as I have always enjoyed organisational security. I wanted to understand and analyse what the constant threats were to an organisation and the language used to depict real life threats. For example, cards, fraud, skimming. 

I then decided to see if I could use Natural Language processing techniques along with Machine Learning to categorise large fields of text into a certain type of data breach. For example, can I scrape a dataset or journal document off the web and deploy it as an unseen story through the model to categorise the type of breach that occured.
